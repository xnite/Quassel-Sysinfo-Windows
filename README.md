# Setup
Compile this code with Visual Studio 2015 or later.
Once compiled, put this into your install path in the scripts directory. If the scripts directory does not exist, then create it. For example: C:\Program Files(x86)\quassel\scripts\SysInfo.exe
If you have trouble compiling, or just don't want to, feel free to use the pre-compiled binary here: https://github.com/xnite/Quassel-Sysinfo-Windows/raw/master/SysInfo/bin/Release/SysInfo.exe

# Usage
To use this script, simply type (or create an alias for) `/exec SysInfo.exe` into your quassel client.
